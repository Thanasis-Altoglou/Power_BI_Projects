ðŸ”‘ At the end of the course:
 1) I gained practical, hands-on experience in learning business intelligence with Power Bi Desktop,
 2) Acquired Knowledge of the business intelligence workflow from end-to-end and,
 3) Learned how to transform raw data into meaningful interactive dashboards and reports.




## Project 1:
### The situation: 
Youâ€™ve just been hired by Adventure Works Cycles*, a global manufacturing company, to
design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution â€“ from scratch!

### The brief:
Your client needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional
performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value customers
All youâ€™ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, containing information about transactions,
returns, products, customers and territories.

## Project 2:
This time we will be working with Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Just like the previousn project, we are going to work through the entire business intelligence workflow: 1) connecting and shaping the source data, 2) building a relational model, 3) adding calculated columns and measures and 4) designing an interactive report.
